# Google Interview Practice

Since it has been a while since I've explored datastructures and algorithms, 
I'm implementing the ones I find interesting and/or can use a refresher for.

Also, I gave my language as javascript so here goes nothing!

## Usage

To install the dependencies with, use `npm install`.

To run all the examples use:
```bash
$ node example.js all
```

Or run a specific example:
```bash
$ node example.js RedBlackTree
```

Or run multiple specific examples:
```bash
$ node example.js RedBlackTree BinaryTree
```
